function [spontaneouStack] =...
    findSpontaneousActivity(spT, discreteTraces, timeLapse)
%FINDSPONTANEOUSACTIVITY returns the activity in which there is no active
%conditioning variables in the experiment. It is structured in a stacked
%form and a PSTH can be easily computed.
%   More information will be given in the future
